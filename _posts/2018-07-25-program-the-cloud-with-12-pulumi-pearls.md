In this post, we'll look at 12 "pearls" -- bite-sized code snippets -- that demonstrate some fun ways you can program the cloud using [Pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi). In my introductory post, I mentioned [a few of my "favorite things"]( http://joeduffyblog.com/2018/06/18/hello-pulumi/#my-favorite-things). Now let's dive into a few specifics, from multi-cloud to cloud-specific, spanning containers, serverless, and infrastructure, and generally highlighting why using real languages is so empowering for cloud scenarios. Since Pulumi lets you do infrastructure-as-code from the lowest-level to the highest, we will cover a lot of interesting ground in short order.
