Almost unbelievably, it's been six months since I blogged.  I promise to return soon with more goods than ever before.
And no, I haven't become a [professional MMA fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Duffy_(fighter)).

The reason for my radio silence is simple: a few months ago, we had our "ah-hah" moment, envisioned a company around it,
[Pulumi](http://pulumi.com/), and began on our journey.  Since then, I've been having the time of my life spelunking at
the intersection of distributed cloud systems, programming languages, and machine intelligence.  I've learned more and
coded more in such a short period of time than ever before, and I've never worked so hard or had as much fun.

Pulumi will be continue in stealth for awhile longer; however, we recently hit some important milestones.  Including
starting to hire!  Our first task is to bring together a world-class team and culture, with diverse perspectives,
capable of the challenging and exciting mission ahead of us.  After building many teams before, it's impossible for me
to overstate how important team and culture will be to our future success, and so that is life itself for year one.

That's where you come in.

If any of these topics excite you -- particularly the intersection of them -- and you like the idea of joining an early
stage startup aiming to reinvent how modern software is built, we would [*love* to hear from you](mailto:joe@pulumi.com).
If you're anything like me, you'll find it a dream opportunity.
