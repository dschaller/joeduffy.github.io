Check out [Soma's
post](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2005/08/11/450640.aspx) about the
`Nullable<T>` DCR we recently implemented...we referred to the project as
`nullbox` internally. This one kept me up at night on a few occassions, but was
a lot of fun. :)

The core change here is that the IL `box` instruction has been modified to
recognize `Nullable<T>`s. For non-Nullables, behavior remains the same; but upon
seeing one, it inspects its `HasValue` property. If `HasValue` is `true`, box peeks
inside the structure, extracts the `T value`, and boxes that instead; otherwise,
box simply leaves behind a `null` reference. Obviously, `unbox` has also been
changed to allow `nulls` to be unboxed back into `Nullable<T>` structures. This had
a rippling effect in the CLR codebase and also required changes to late-bound
semantics to mimic the static case.

The result is that given

    int? x = null;
    object y = x;

both expressions

    x == null   y == null

evaluate to `true`. And furthermore, given

    bool F<T>(T t)
    {
      return t == null;
    }

the following expressions

    F(x)   F(y)

also evaluate to `true`.

I intend to post a more detailed summary of the DCR over the coming week[s].
